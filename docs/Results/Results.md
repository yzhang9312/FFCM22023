{: .note } 
We distinguish between model **validation** and model **test**. Validation refers to comparing against experimental data in which the model prediction uncertainty is given; whereas test means only a nomial prediction is compared to the data. Validations are made against the set of experimental data from which the target values are extracted. Tests are made for a wider range of combustion data not considered in the target set.
