Foundational fuels consist of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, small hydrocarbons up to C<sub>4</sub> species, including benzene and toluene. An accurate, detailed foundational fuel chemistry model is critical to modeling combustion of all hydrocarbon compounds. The coverage and importance of foundational fuels is discussed, with a brief review of the history for detailed chemistry modeling of small hydrocarbons.
