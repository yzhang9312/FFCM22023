# Experimental Data
Extensive literature review was conducted to consolidate the Stanford Fundamental Combustion Property Database (SFCPD), which collects the legacy fundamental combustion property data for relevant foundational fuels, including laminar flame speed, shock tube ignition delay time and speciation time-history measurement. Representative conditions are selected as targets. The 1192 selected targets have uncertainty quantified considering the statistical consistency and generic effects.
