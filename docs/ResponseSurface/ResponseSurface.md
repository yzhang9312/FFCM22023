# Response Surface
In kinetic model optimization and uncertainty minimization, a critical step is the need of a surrogate model (or response surface) that maps a predicted combustion property (e.g., ignition delay) to reaction model parameters within their ranges of uncertainties. The response surfaces allow the objective function evaluated simply using algebraic relationships, instead of directly solving differential equations for each combustion target, which is infeasible for large-scale optimization.
