# Trial Model
{: .no_toc }
The trial model includes the state of knowledge for reaction pathways, rate constant expressions, rate parameter uncertainties, and the thermochemical and transport data for reaction kinetics of C<sub>0-4</sub> species. A trial model with 96 species and 1054 reactions was compiled by evaluating kinetic studies from 227 papers that date back to 1960.
